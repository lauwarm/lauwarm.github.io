## Welcome

You have found my Blog. More precisely the About Page.

## Who am I

A guy, living somewhere in Europe.

## What is all of this

Sometimes Software. Sometimes Hardware. MacOS. Docker. IoT. Raspberry Pi. Arduino. Microcontrollers.

Pictures taken with a Fujifilm X100F will make a rare Appearance. Especially ones I used
[Filmsimulations](https://fujixweekly.com/) with.

There will be Posts about Long Distance Hiking and Cycling.
Got a few Tours on my Bucket List which needs crossing out.

## Where else to find me

I use Github, Instagram, Twitter. I have a Twitch Account too.

I do have a cozy Place for all my [Social Links](https://mugenbatscha.me).
