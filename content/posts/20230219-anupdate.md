### It's been too long

I have some posts in the pipeline, which needs finalization.
Currently tough, I'm trying to finish the Hugo theme [_mugenbatscha_](https://github.com/lauwarm/hugo-theme-mugenbatscha), which this blog is using.

#### There are still a lot of small adjustments to make

- The landing page still uses [_feather icons_](https://feathericons.com/), which seem to have [deprecated branding logos](https://github.com/feathericons/feather/issues/763). The question is, if I should just download a bunch of _SVGs_ and ship them with the theme, or use something like [_simple icons_](https://simpleicons.org/)?
- Based on [Google PageSpeed Insight](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), there is a lot to improve regarding accessibility. Especially _alt_ attributes.
- The [README.md](https://github.com/lauwarm/hugo-theme-mugenbatscha/blob/main/README.md) could use an update. It's probably not that useful to someone who wishes to use this theme for ones own blog.

#### Improvements, which are live right now

- The links on the landing page do not open a new tab anymore. Consensus says, if you do not loose important work, do not open in a new tab.
- The mobile scaling has gotten an update. The menu bar now features better padding around the icons.
- The landing page is centered.
- The landing page got the footer at the bottom.
- Taxonomy got an overhaul.
- Dev Container uses a more up-to-date version of node and hugo.

#### Changes the blog has experienced

- A new URL.
- Migration from IONOS Deploy Now to Azure. This will get a post of its own.
- Migration from Azure to Github Pages. This will receive a post of its own.
- Connecting a custom URL with Azure, and now Github Pages. Maybe this will get a post of it's own, or be integrated in the migration posts. We will see.
