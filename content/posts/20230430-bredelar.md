Went on a short Trip to test out a new Backpack and Socks I got.

The Backpack is a [Jack Wolfskin Highland Trail 55+5 Men](https://www.jack-wolfskin.de/highland-trail-555-men/2010091_1274_OS.html).
The Socks are the [Injinji Trail Midweight Mini-Crew](https://www.injinji.com/trail-midweight-mini-crew.html).

The Jack Wolfskin Highland has 30L more volume than my old Backpack from Mammut. I used the Mammut Creon Tour for a multiday hike. Served the purpose well for doing a hut hike, where you don't need to carry your own food or a tent. The next multiday hike will not be a hut hike though. So more capacity is needed. To test the Backpack it weight 13,2 kg. The shoulder and waist straps are fairly comfortable. One thing I learned, maybe use some tape on the hips till my body is used to the load.

I bought the Socks because the last multiday Hike blessed me with terrible blisters around the toes. A common tip is to tape the toes. Also _Hirschtalg_ is often mentioned. Taping the toes seemed really excessive so I opted for toe socks. I have to admit the Socks felt weird. Even after a 6 hour hike they felt strange. But no blisters or harsh spots. Definitly worth it so far.

You can find the Tour on my [Komoot Profile](https://www.komoot.de/tour/1091176512).

At last, some impressions from the tour.
